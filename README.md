# Object detection app


Object detection is a popular computer vision application that involves identifying and locating objects within an image or video. OpenCV is a widely used library for computer vision and image processing, while TensorFlow is a popular open-source platform for building machine learning models. Kotlin, on the other hand, is a programming language that we will be using for developing our object detection app.

Our object detection app will be built using OpenCV and TensorFlow, and it will be developed using Kotlin. The app will be designed to detect any object in an image or video, regardless of its type, size, or shape.

To achieve this, our app will use a deep learning model trained on a large dataset of images. The model will be able to detect various objects in images by analyzing their features and patterns. The model will be built using TensorFlow, which is a powerful tool for training and deploying machine learning models.

The app will be designed to work on both mobile devices and desktop computers. It will be equipped with a user-friendly interface that allows users to easily upload images or videos for object detection. Once an image or video is uploaded, the app will use OpenCV to process the image or video and detect any objects in it. The detected objects will be highlighted and labeled on the image or video.

One of the key features of our app is its ability to detect multiple objects in an image or video. This means that if there are several objects in an image or video, the app will be able to detect and label all of them.

In addition to object detection, our app will also include other features such as object tracking, which allows users to track the movement of objects in a video. The app will also include an option to save the results of object detection, so users can easily review and share their findings.

Overall, our object detection app will be a powerful tool for detecting any object in an image or video. By leveraging the capabilities of OpenCV, TensorFlow, and Kotlin, we will be able to create a highly accurate and efficient object detection app that can be used in a wide range of applications, from security and surveillance to healthcare and entertainment.
